CoffeeTime is a `Err <http://errbot.net/>`_ plugin which tells who has to bring the coffee.
If you ever end up in a fight about who has to bring the coffee then this plugin is the solution.

Just say ``!coffeetime`` in a group chat and the Err bot will tell you who has to bring the coffee.

What people say about this plugin
=================================

* "We like to get our own coffee."
* "Coffeetime?!"
* "Double espresso please."

Installation
============

For now just go to your Err Bot plugin folder and checkout this repo.
After restarting Err the plugin should be loaded and ready to use.

Current state of the project
============================

This plugin was developed for fun and learning.
At this moment the plugin is quite simple and useless since everybody
likes to leave the PC for a few minutes in order to get some coffee.

I may add new features to this plugin in the future.
I also try to review potential PR's as soon as possible.
